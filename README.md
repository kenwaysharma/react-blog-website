## :label: How to run the application?
After downloading or cloning the application, open terminal in the same folder and go into the '.\Backend Setup Latest\' folder using `cd '.\Backend Setup Latest\'`.

Run `npm init`
then run `nodemon start`

You should see `Express is running on port 2000` on the terminal.

### Back-end of the application is now running.

Similarly, for running the front-end, open a new terminal in the `\react-blog-website-main` folder and go into the .\front-end\ folder using `cd .\front-end\`.

Run `npm init`
then run `npm start`

A new browser window should open.

### Front-end of the application is now running.

## :warning: Note:
Make sure you have MongoDB installed and initialised using `mongod` on a terminal.

Back-end is running on `port: 2000` by default.
Front-end is running on `port: 3000` by default.

:hammer: This app was built using Nodejs, Reactjs, Expressjs, and MongoDB.
